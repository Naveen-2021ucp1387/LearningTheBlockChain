### Theory Questions

26. **Difference between Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS):** PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks, consuming a lot of energy. PoS, on the other hand, selects validators based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral, making it more energy-efficient.
27. **Role of a Full Node:** A Full Node maintains a complete copy of the blockchain ledger, independently verifies all transactions and blocks, and communicates with other nodes to ensure the network's accuracy and current state.
28. **Primary functions of a blockchain wallet:** A blockchain wallet stores private and public keys, enables users to send and receive cryptocurrencies, and tracks their balance.
29. **Difference between Light Node and Full Node:** Light Nodes store only a portion of the blockchain relevant to their transactions, making them faster and more efficient but less secure than Full Nodes, which store the entire blockchain history.
30. **Purpose of a consensus algorithm:** A consensus algorithm ensures all nodes in the blockchain network agree on the validity of transactions and the state of the blockchain, maintaining network integrity and security.
31. **Decentralization in blockchain:** Decentralization refers to distributing the control and decision-making of a blockchain network across a diverse set of nodes rather than relying on a centralized authority, enhancing security and resilience.
32. **How miner nodes create new blocks:** Miner nodes solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain, receiving rewards in the form of cryptocurrency for their efforts.
33. **Advantages of Proof of Stake (PoS) over Proof of Work (PoW):** PoS is more energy-efficient, reduces the risk of centralization, and incentivizes long-term participation by requiring validators to hold and lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency.
34. **Role of a Staking Node:** A Staking Node validates transactions using a proof-of-stake mechanism, where participants lock up funds as collateral to be randomly selected for block validation, ensuring network security and earning rewards.
35. **Difference between Web3 and Web2:** Web3 focuses on decentralization, utilizing blockchain technology to create a more transparent, secure, and user-controlled internet, whereas Web2 is characterized by centralized platforms and services.
