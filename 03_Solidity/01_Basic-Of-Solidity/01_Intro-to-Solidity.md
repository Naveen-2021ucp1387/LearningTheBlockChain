## What is Solidity?
Solidity is a brand-new programming language created by Ethereum, which is the second-largest market of cryptocurrency by capitalization. It was released in 2015 and led by Christian Reitwiessner. Some key features of Solidity are listed below:

- Solidity is a high-level programming language designed for implementing smart contracts.
- It is a statically typed, object-oriented (contract-oriented) language.
- Solidity is highly influenced by Python, C++, and JavaScript, and it runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- Solidity supports complex user-defined programming, libraries, and inheritance.
- Solidity is the primary language for blockchain-running platforms.
- Solidity can be used to create contracts like voting, blind auctions, crowdfunding, multi-signature wallets, etc.

## Ethereum
Ethereum is a decentralized open-source platform based on the blockchain domain, used to run smart contracts, i.e., applications that execute the program exactly as programmed without the possibility of fraud, third-party interference, censorship, or downtime. It serves as a platform for nearly 260,000 different cryptocurrencies. Ether is a cryptocurrency generated by Ethereum miners, used as a reward for the computations performed to secure the blockchain.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment for executing smart contracts in Ethereum. It focuses on providing security and executing untrusted code using an international network of public nodes. The EVM is specialized to prevent Denial-of-Service attacks and ensures that the program does not access each other's state, while also ensuring communication without potential interference.

## Smart Contract
Smart contracts are high-level program codes that are compiled to EVM byte code and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They allow credible transactions without third-party interference. These transactions are trackable and irreversible. Languages used to write smart contracts include Solidity (a language library with similarities to C and JavaScript), Serpent (similar to Python, but deprecated), LLL (a low-level Lisp-like language), and Mutan (Go-based, but deprecated).

### Example
In the below example, we discuss a sample Solidity program to demonstrate how to write a smart contract in Solidity.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0 
pragma solidity >= 0.4.16 < 0.9.0;

/// @title A contract to demonstrate how to write a smart contract 
/// @author Jitendra Kumar
/// @notice This contract shows how to set the value of state variables, calculate the sum, and get this sum value from the smart contract
 
contract Test
{ 
    // Declaring state variables 
    uint public var1;
    uint public var2;
    uint public sum;
   
    // Defining a public function  
    // that sets the value of the state variables 
    function set(uint x, uint y) public
    { 
        var1 = x;
        var2 = y;
        sum = var1 + var2;
    } 
       
    // Defining a function to 
    // return the sum of 
    // state variables 
    function get() public view returns (uint) { 
        return sum; 
    } 
}
```
## Setting Up Solidity

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js and npm**: Solidity is supported by various tools and frameworks that require Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: A good code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Atom, or any IDE that supports Solidity.


### Steps to Set Up Solidity

#### 1. Install Node.js and npm
Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm.

#### 2. Install Truffle
Truffle is a popular development framework for Ethereum that provides a suite of tools for developing and testing smart contracts.

```sh
npm install -g truffle
