# Inheritance in Solidity

## Introduction

Inheritance in Solidity allows contracts to inherit properties and methods from other contracts. This feature promotes code reuse and modular design, making it easier to build and maintain complex smart contracts. Solidity supports single inheritance, where a contract can inherit from one parent contract, as well as multiple inheritance, where a contract can inherit from multiple parent contracts.

## Single Inheritance

Single inheritance involves one contract inheriting from a single base contract. The derived contract inherits all public and internal state variables and functions from the base contract.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Base {
    uint public baseValue;

    function setBaseValue(uint _value) public {
        baseValue = _value;
    }
}

contract Derived is Base {
    function incrementBaseValue() public {
        baseValue += 1;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Derived` contract inherits from the `Base` contract. It has access to the `baseValue` state variable and the `setBaseValue` function from the `Base` contract. It also adds its own function, `incrementBaseValue`.

## Multiple Inheritance

Solidity allows multiple inheritance, where a contract can inherit from multiple base contracts. When using multiple inheritance, Solidity applies the "C3 linearization" algorithm to resolve conflicts in method resolution order.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract A {
    function funcA() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Function A";
    }
}

contract B {
    function funcB() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Function B";
    }
}

contract C is A, B {
    function funcC() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Function C";
    }
}
```

In this example, the `C` contract inherits from both `A` and `B` contracts. It has access to `funcA` from `A` and `funcB` from `B`, as well as its own function, `funcC`.

## Overriding Functions

In Solidity, derived contracts can override functions from base contracts. To override a function, use the `override` keyword in the derived contract. The base contract function must be marked as `virtual` to allow overriding.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Base {
    function greet() public pure virtual returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from Base";
    }
}

contract Derived is Base {
    function greet() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from Derived";
    }
}
```

In this example, the `greet` function in the `Derived` contract overrides the `greet` function in the `Base` contract. The `virtual` keyword in the `Base` contract allows it to be overridden, and the `override` keyword in the `Derived` contract specifies that it is overriding a base function.

## Using Super Keyword

The `super` keyword in Solidity allows calling a function from a parent contract, especially when dealing with multiple inheritance and function overrides.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract A {
    function greet() public pure virtual returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from A";
    }
}

contract B is A {
    function greet() public pure virtual override returns (string memory) {
        return string(abi.encodePacked("B says: ", super.greet()));
    }
}

contract C is B {
    function greet() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return string(abi.encodePacked("C says: ", super.greet()));
    }
}
```

In this example, `C` inherits from `B`, which inherits from `A`. The `greet` function in `C` uses the `super` keyword to call the `greet` function from `B`, which in turn calls the `greet` function from `A`.

## Visibility and Access Control

Inherited contracts must respect the visibility of functions and state variables. Functions and variables that are `private` in the base contract are not accessible in derived contracts.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Base {
    uint private baseValue; // private: not accessible in derived contracts
    uint internal internalValue; // internal: accessible in derived contracts

    function setBaseValue(uint _value) public {
        baseValue = _value;
    }
}

contract Derived is Base {
    function getInternalValue() public view returns (uint) {
        return internalValue; // Accessible
    }

    function getBaseValue() public view returns (uint) {
        // return baseValue; // Not Accessible: private in Base
    }
}
```

In this example, `internalValue` is accessible in the `Derived` contract, but `baseValue` is not because it is `private` in the `Base` contract.

## Conclusion

Inheritance in Solidity allows developers to create modular, reusable, and organized smart contracts by extending existing contracts and reusing their functionality. Understanding how to effectively use inheritance, including single and multiple inheritance, function overriding, and visibility rules, is essential for developing complex smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
