# Structs in Solidity

## Introduction

Structs in Solidity are custom data types that allow grouping related variables together. They are particularly useful for modeling more complex data structures that represent objects or records, similar to how structs are used in languages like C and C++.

## Defining Structs

Structs are defined using the `struct` keyword followed by the struct name and its body, which contains the variables. Each variable in a struct can be of any type, including other structs.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StructExample {
    struct Person {
        string name;
        uint age;
        address wallet;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` struct has three properties: `name`, `age`, and `wallet`.

## Declaring and Using Structs

### Declaring Struct Instances

Once a struct is defined, you can declare instances of the struct type either as state variables, local variables, or as storage/memory variables within functions.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StructExample {
    struct Person {
        string name;
        uint age;
        address wallet;
    }

    Person public person;

    constructor(string memory _name, uint _age) {
        person = Person(_name, _age, msg.sender);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` struct instance is declared as a state variable `person`, and it is initialized in the constructor.

## Structs in Arrays and Mappings

Structs can be used within arrays and mappings to create more complex data structures.

### Example with Array

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StructArrayExample {
    struct Person {
        string name;
        uint age;
        address wallet;
    }

    Person[] public people;

    function addPerson(string memory _name, uint _age) public {
        people.push(Person(_name, _age, msg.sender));
    }

    function getPerson(uint _index) public view returns (string memory, uint, address) {
        Person storage person = people[_index];
        return (person.name, person.age, person.wallet);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` struct is used within an array `people`. The `addPerson` function adds new `Person` instances to the array, and the `getPerson` function retrieves a `Person` from the array by index.

### Example with Mapping

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StructMappingExample {
    struct Person {
        string name;
        uint age;
        address wallet;
    }

    mapping(address => Person) public people;

    function addPerson(string memory _name, uint _age) public {
        people[msg.sender] = Person(_name, _age, msg.sender);
    }

    function getPerson(address _address) public view returns (string memory, uint, address) {
        Person storage person = people[_address];
        return (person.name, person.age, person.wallet);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` struct is used within a mapping `people`, where the key is an address and the value is a `Person` instance. The `addPerson` function adds new `Person` instances to the mapping, and the `getPerson` function retrieves a `Person` from the mapping by address.

## Modifying Structs

Structs can be modified after they are created. This can be done by directly accessing and updating their fields.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ModifyStructExample {
    struct Person {
        string name;
        uint age;
        address wallet;
    }

    Person public person;

    constructor(string memory _name, uint _age) {
        person = Person(_name, _age, msg.sender);
    }

    function updatePerson(string memory _name, uint _age) public {
        person.name = _name;
        person.age = _age;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `updatePerson` function modifies the fields of the `person` struct instance.

## Nested Structs

Structs can be nested within other structs to create complex data structures.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract NestedStructExample {
    struct Contact {
        string email;
        string phone;
    }

    struct Person {
        string name;
        uint age;
        address wallet;
        Contact contact;
    }

    Person public person;

    constructor(string memory _name, uint _age, string memory _email, string memory _phone) {
        person = Person(_name, _age, msg.sender, Contact(_email, _phone));
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Contact` struct is nested within the `Person` struct. The constructor initializes the nested struct fields.

## Conclusion

Structs in Solidity provide a powerful way to model and manage complex data structures within smart contracts. By understanding how to define, use, and manipulate structs, you can create more organized and readable code, making your contracts easier to understand and maintain.
