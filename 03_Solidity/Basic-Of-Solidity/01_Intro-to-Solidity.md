## What is Solidity?
Solidity is a high-level programming language designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and other blockchain platforms. It is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features. Solidity is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript.

## Key Features of Solidity
- **Statically Typed**: Variables must be declared with their types.
- **Supports Inheritance**: Contracts can inherit properties and methods from other contracts.
- **Libraries**: Allows for code reuse and modularity.
- **Complex User-Defined Types**: Supports structs, arrays, and mappings.

## Setting Up Solidity

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js and npm**: Solidity is supported by various tools and frameworks that require Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: A good code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Atom, or any IDE that supports Solidity.

### Steps to Set Up Solidity

#### 1. Install Node.js and npm
Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm.

#### 2. Install Truffle
Truffle is a popular development framework for Ethereum that provides a suite of tools for developing and testing smart contracts.

```sh
npm install -g truffle
