# Smart Contracts in Blockchain

## What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract, like any contract, establishes the terms of an agreement. But unlike a traditional contract, a smart contract’s terms are executed as code running on a blockchain like Ethereum. Smart contracts allow developers to build apps that take advantage of blockchain security, reliability, and accessibility while offering sophisticated peer-to-peer functionality — everything from loans and insurance to logistics and gaming.

A smart contract, like any contract, establishes the terms of an agreement. But unlike a traditional contract, a smart contract’s terms are executed as code running on a blockchain like Ethereum. Smart contracts allow developers to build apps that take advantage of blockchain security, reliability, and accessibility while offering sophisticated peer-to-peer functionality — everything from loans and insurance to logistics and gaming.

Just like any contract, smart contracts lay out the terms of an agreement or deal. What makes smart contracts “smart,” however, is that the terms are established and executed as code running on a blockchain, rather than on paper sitting on a lawyer’s desk. Smart contracts expand on the basic idea behind Bitcoin — sending and receiving money without a “trusted intermediary” like a bank in the middle — to make it possible to securely automate and decentralize virtually any kind of deal or transaction, no matter how complex. And because they run on a blockchain like Ethereum, they offer security, reliability, and borderless accessibility.

## Why are Smart Contracts Important?

Smart contracts allow developers to build a wide variety of decentralized apps and tokens. They’re used in everything from new financial tools to logistics and game experiences, and they’re stored on a blockchain like any other crypto transaction. Once a smart-contract app has been added to the blockchain, it generally can’t be reversed or changed (although there are some exceptions).

Smart-contract-powered apps are often referred to as “decentralized applications” or “dapps” – and they include decentralized finance (or DeFi) tech that aims to transform the banking industry. DeFi apps allow cryptocurrency holders to engage in complex financial transactions — saving, loans, insurance — without a bank or other financial institution taking a cut and from anywhere in the world. Some of the more popular current smart-contract powered applications include:

- **Uniswap:** A decentralized exchange that allows users, via smart contract, to trade certain kinds of crypto without any central authority setting the exchange rates.
- **Compound:** A platform that uses smart contracts to let investors earn interest and borrowers to instantly get a loan without the need for a bank in the middle.
- **USDC:** A cryptocurrency that is pegged via smart contract to the US dollar, making one USDC worth one U.S. dollar. USDC is part of a newer category of digital money known as stablecoins.

So how would you use these smart contract-powered tools? Imagine you’re holding some Ethereum that you’d like to trade for USDC. You could put some Ethereum into Uniswap, which, via smart contract, can automatically find you the best exchange rate, make the trade, and send you your USDC. You could then put some of your USDC into Compound to lend to others and receive an algorithmically determined rate of interest — all without using a bank or other financial institution.

In traditional finance, swapping currencies is expensive and time-consuming. And it isn't easy or secure for individuals to loan out their liquid assets to strangers on the other side of the world. But smart contracts make both of those scenarios, and a vast variety of others, possible.

## How Do Smart Contracts Work?

Smart contracts were first proposed in the 1990s by a computer scientist and lawyer named Nick Szabo. Szabo famously compared a smart contract to a vending machine. Imagine a machine that sells cans of soda for a quarter. If you put a dollar into the machine and select a soda, the machine is hardwired to either produce your drink and 75 cents in change, or (if your choice is sold out) to prompt you to make another selection or get your dollar back. This is an example of a simple smart contract. Just like a soda machine can automate a sale without a human intermediary, smart contracts can automate virtually any kind of exchange.

Currently, Ethereum is the most popular smart contract platform, but many other cryptocurrency blockchains (including EOS, Neo, Tezos, Tron, Polkadot, and Algorand) can run them. A smart contract can be created and deployed to a blockchain by anyone. Their code is transparent and publicly verifiable, which means that any interested party can see exactly what logic a smart contract follows when it receives digital assets.

Smart contracts are written in a variety of programming languages (including Solidity, Web Assembly, and Michelson). On the Ethereum network, each smart contract’s code is stored on the blockchain, allowing any interested party to inspect the contract’s code and current state to verify its functionality.

Each computer on the network (or “node”) stores a copy of all existing smart contracts and their current state alongside the blockchain and transaction data.

When a smart contract receives funds from a user, its code is executed by all nodes in the network in order to reach a consensus about the outcome and resulting flow of value. This is what allows smart contracts to securely run without any central authority, even when users are making complex financial transactions with unknown entities.

To execute a smart contract on the Ethereum network, you will generally have to pay a fee called “gas” (so named because these fees keep the blockchain running).

Once deployed onto a blockchain, smart contracts generally can’t be altered, even by their creator. (There are exceptions to this rule.) This helps ensure that they can’t be censored or shut down.

## Features of Smart Contracts

The following are some essential characteristics of a smart contract:

- **Distributed:** Everyone on the network is guaranteed to have a copy of all the conditions of the smart contract and they cannot be changed by one of the parties. A smart contract is replicated and distributed by all the nodes connected to the network.
- **Deterministic:** Smart contracts can only perform functions for which they are designed only when the required conditions are met. The final outcome will not vary, no matter who executes the smart contract.
- **Immutable:** Once deployed smart contract cannot be changed, it can only be removed as long as the functionality is implemented previously.
- **Autonomy:** There is no third party involved. The contract is made by you and shared between the parties. No intermediaries are involved which minimizes bullying and grants full authority to the dealing parties. Also, the smart contract is maintained and executed by all the nodes on the network, thus removing all the controlling power from any one party’s hand.
- **Customizable:** Smart contracts have the ability for modification or we can say customization before being launched to do what the user wants it to do.
- **Transparent:** Smart contracts are always stored on a public distributed ledger called blockchain due to which the code is visible to everyone, whether or not they are participants in the smart contract.
- **Trustless:** These are not required by third parties to verify the integrity of the process or to check whether the required conditions are met.
- **Self-verifying:** These are self-verifying due to automated possibilities.
- **Self-enforcing:** These are self-enforcing when the conditions and rules are met at all stages.

## Capabilities of Smart Contracts

- **Accuracy:** Smart contracts are accurate to the limit a programmer has accurately coded them for execution.
- **Automation:** Smart contracts can automate the tasks/ processes that are done manually.
- **Speed:** Smart contracts use software code to automate tasks, thereby reducing the time it takes to maneuver through all the human interaction-related processes. Because everything is coded, the time taken to do all the work is the time taken for the code in the smart contract to execute.
- **Backup:** Every node in the blockchain maintains the shared ledger, providing probably the best backup facility.
- **Security:** Cryptography can make sure that the assets are safe and sound. Even if someone breaks the encryption, the hacker will have to modify all the blocks that come after the block which has been modified. Please note that this is a highly difficult and computation-intensive task and is practically impossible for a small or medium-sized organization to do.
- **Savings:** Smart contracts save money as they eliminate the presence of intermediaries in the process. Also, the money spent on the paperwork is minimal to zero.
- **Manages information:** Smart contract manages users’ agreement, and stores information about an application like domain registration, membership records, etc.
- **Multi-signature accounts:** Smart contracts support multi-signature accounts to distribute funds as soon as all the parties involved confirm the agreement.

## Types of Smart Contracts

1. **Smart Legal Contract:** These follow the format seen in contracts: “If this occurs, then this will occur.” Legal smart contracts provide more openness between contracting entities than traditional documents because they are stored on blockchain and cannot be altered. Contracts are executed by the parties using digital signatures.

2. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):** DAOs are democratic organizations with voting powers granted by a smart contract. A DAO is a blockchain-based entity with a shared goal under collective governance. There is no such thing as an executive or president. Instead, the organization’s operations and the distribution of assets are governed by blockchain-based principles that are incorporated into the contract’s code.

3. **Application Logic Contracts:** Application-based code that usually keeps up with multiple other blockchain contracts makes up application logic contracts, or ALCs. It permits device-to-device interactions such as blockchain integration and the Internet of Things. These are signed between computers and other contracts rather than between people or organizations like other kinds of smart contracts.

## How Do Smart Contracts Work?

A smart contract is just a digital contract with the security coding of the blockchain.

- It has details and permissions written in code that require an exact sequence of events to take place to trigger the agreement of the terms mentioned in the smart contract.
- It can also include the time constraints that must be adhered to.
- Once the sequence has taken place, the smart contract is executed automatically.
- A copy of the contract and the sequences involved are stored on the blockchain as a permanent record.
- Each contract is given a unique cryptographic code, which makes it easy to identify and immutable.
- In this way, contracts cannot be altered after they are written and executed, which means there can be no tampering or fraud.

## Examples of Smart Contracts

- **Insurance Claims:** One of the applications for smart contracts is in the insurance industry, where they can be used to automate and streamline the claims process. The insurance claim process can be streamlined by automatically verifying and processing claims based on pre-defined rules and conditions. This reduces administrative costs and speeds up claim settlements.
- **Supply Chain Management:** Smart contracts can help track the movement of goods and ensure that they meet specified conditions. Smart contracts can track the movement of goods across a supply chain, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of fraud. Payments can be automatically triggered upon the successful delivery and verification of goods.
- **Healthcare:** Smart contracts can be used to securely share patient data between healthcare providers, ensuring privacy and accuracy. Smart contracts can facilitate the sharing of patient data between healthcare providers while ensuring privacy and data integrity. They can also automate billing and payment processes in healthcare.
- **Real Estate:** Smart contracts can be used to automate property transactions and transfers of ownership. Smart contracts can automate real estate transactions, including property transfers and rental agreements. They ensure that all conditions are met before the transfer of ownership or funds takes place.
- **Voting Systems:** Smart contracts can be used to create secure and transparent voting systems that ensure the integrity of the voting process. Smart contracts can be used to create secure and transparent voting systems, reducing the risk of fraud and ensuring the accuracy of election results.
- **Finance and Banking:** Smart contracts are used to automate and secure financial transactions, loans, and payments. In decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts enable peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and trading without the need for intermediaries. They can automate the execution of financial agreements, such as loans and derivatives.
- **Gaming and Digital Assets:** Smart contracts enable the creation and exchange of in-game assets and digital collectibles. Smart contracts can be used in the gaming industry to create and trade in-game assets, digital collectibles, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They ensure the ownership and scarcity of digital items.

Smart contracts have the potential to revolutionize various industries by providing transparency, security, and automation. However, they also present challenges related to legal enforcement, security vulnerabilities, and the need for clear and accurate coding. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, smart contracts are likely to play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of digital transactions and agreements.
