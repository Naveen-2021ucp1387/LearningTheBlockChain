# Cryptocurrency: Meaning and Definition

## What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority; instead, they use a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.

## How Does Cryptocurrency Work?

Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders.

- **Mining:** Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins.
- **Transactions:** Users can buy cryptocurrencies from brokers and then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets. Transactions are recorded in a public ledger.
- **Ownership:** Owning cryptocurrency means having a key that allows you to move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.
