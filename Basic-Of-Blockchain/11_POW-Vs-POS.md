# Proof of Work (PoW) vs. Proof of Stake (PoS)

| Feature                        | Proof of Work (PoW)                                          | Proof of Stake (PoS)                                            |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consensus Mechanism**       | Mining (solving cryptographic puzzles)                      | Staking (committing cryptocurrency)                            |
| **Energy Consumption**        | High (due to computational power required for mining)       | Low (validators do not need extensive computational resources)  |
| **Hardware Requirement**      | Specialized hardware (e.g., ASICs, GPUs)                    | Standard hardware (computer, internet connection)               |
| **Security**                  | 51% attack requires 51% of total hash power                 | 51% attack requires 51% of total staked cryptocurrency          |
| **Decentralization**          | Can become centralized due to mining pools                  | More decentralized as staking is more accessible                |
| **Environmental Impact**      | Significant (high electricity consumption)                  | Minimal (low electricity consumption)                           |
| **Incentives**                | Block rewards and transaction fees                          | Transaction fees and sometimes block rewards                    |
| **Block Creation**            | First miner to solve the puzzle creates the block           | Validator selected based on stake and other factors             |
| **Initial Distribution**      | Coins are minted via mining                                 | Coins are often pre-mined or introduced via initial PoW phase   |
| **Transaction Speed**         | Generally slower due to high computational requirements     | Potentially faster with mechanisms like sharding                |
| **Example Blockchains**       | Bitcoin, Litecoin                                           | Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Peercoin                                 |
| **Slashing (Penalty)**        | Not applicable                                              | Validators can lose staked funds for malicious behavior         |
| **Rewards Distribution**      | Proportional to computational power                         | Proportional to the amount of stake                             |
